The workflow will cover: 1) creating a searchable public collection of full-text titles within the HathiTrust Digital Library and uploading it to the HTRC Portal, 2) analyzing and visualizing legacy MARC data for the collection using MarcEdit, OpenRefine and Tableau, and 3) using the text analysis tools in the HTRC Portal to look for trends and patterns in the full text of the collection.},

This challenge increases for sub-genres and other categories of text data that are less distinct from the whole. This project pilots machine learning methods and word feature analysis for identifying Black Fantastic genre texts within the HathiTrust Digital Library. These texts are sometimes referred to as “Afrofuturism” but more commonly today described as “Black Fantastic,” in which African Diaspora artists and creators engage with the intersections of race and technology in their works with a primary focus on world-building. Black Fantastic texts pose a challenge to genre classification, as they incorporate aspects of science fiction and fantasy with typical characteristics of African Diaspora-produced literature. This paper presents and reports on results from a pilot predictive modeling process to computationally identify Black Fantastic texts using curated word feature sets for each class of data: general English-language fiction, Black-authored fiction, and Black Fantastic fiction.},

    title = {Page-{Level} {Genre} {Metadata} for {English}-{Language} {Volumes} in {HathiTrust}, 1700-1922},
    abstract = {Page-by-page genre predictions for 854,476 English-language volumes printed between 1700 and 1922, keyed to the texts in HathiTrust Digital Library. This research was supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies.The genre predictions were produced by an ensemble of regularized logistic classifiers, and are intended to support research that explores broad trends in literary history. Since volumes usually contain multiple genres, page-level metadata is necessary to create machine-readable collections in a particular genre.Only very broad categories are discriminated here (fiction, poetry, drama, nonfiction prose, paratext). Overall average accuracy is 93.6\%, but confidence metrics are included that allow researchers to trade recall for enhanced precision. For instance, the filtered subsets of fiction, poetry, and drama (included here as fiction.tar.gz, etc.) have higher than 97\% precision.Predictions are included as JSON objects in separate files, one for each volume. The tar.gz files prefixed with "all" include all 854,476 volumes, divided by date. The tar.gz files named for genres contain subsets of volumes that have been filtered to achieve greater than 97\% precision in that particular genre. Specifically, they include 18,111 vols containing drama, 102,349 vols containing fiction, and 61,286 vols containing poetry. These datasets were filtered both with confidence metrics created by a logistic model and by manual editing. Ringers.csv is a list of volumes that we had to manually remove; scholars who select their own datasets from the larger collection (of files beginning "all") may also want to consider filtering out these tricky cases.Accompanying meta.csv files provide summary volume-level metadata for each collection. For full details of methods and data format, see the interim project report at (http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1281251).

    abstract = {Digital humanities methods have been at the heart of a recent series of high-profile historical research projects. But these approaches raise new questions about reproducibility and verifiability in a field of research where grounding one’s conclusions in a body of historical evidence is crucial. While there have been extensive debates about the nature and methods of historical research since the nineteenth century, the underlying assumption has generally been that documenting one’s sources in a series of footnotes is essential to enable other researchers to test the validity of the research. Even if this approach never amounted to “reproducibility” in the sense of scientific experimentation, it might still be seen as broadly analogous, since the evidence can be reassembled to see the basis for the explanations that were offered and to test their validity. This essay examines how new digital methods like topic modelling, network analysis, knowledge graphs, species models, and various kinds of visualizations are affecting the process of reproducing and verifying historical research. Using examples drawn from recent research projects, it identifies a need for thorough documentation and publication of the different layers of digital research: digital and digitized collections, descriptive metadata, the software used for analysis and visualizations, and the various settings and configurations.},

    abstract = {Position statements were authored by participants of Collections as Data: State of the field and future directions, a working event held April 25-26 in Vancouver, Canada as part of the Mellon foundation supported Collections as Data: Part to Whole. 
Position statement authors responded to the following prompt:
We ask that you write a brief position statement (1-2 pages) derived from direct or related experience salient to the scope of work described in Collections as Data: Part to Whole (see grant narrative and sub grantee final reports). Please send to us by April 7. We strongly welcome bridging, divergence, and provocation in your position statements. Is there something concrete or conceptual we are missing? Are there questions and communities we aren’t currently considering? This is an opportunity to highlight aspects of your experience that relate to collections as data and will help stage interaction at the face-to-face meeting as we collectively consider the state of the field and future directions together. As a whole, these position statements will form a collective resource to be shared publicly with any community interested in collections as data.},

    abstract = {This article is motivated by the ‘reproducibility crisis’ that is being discussed intensely in fields such as Psychology or Biology but is also becoming increasingly relevant to Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Digital Humanities, not least in the context of Open Science. Using the phrase ‘repetitive research’ as an umbrella term for a range of practices from replication to follow-up research, and with the objective to provide clarity and help establish best practices in this area, this article focuses on two issues: First, the conceptual space of repetitive research is described across five key dimensions, namely those of the research question or hypothesis, the dataset, the method of analysis, the team, and the results or conclusions. Second, building on this new description of the conceptual space and on earlier terminological work, a specific set of terms for recurring scenarios of repetitive research is proposed. For each scenario, its position in the conceptual space is defined, its typical purpose and added value in the research process are discussed, the requirements for enabling it are described, and illustrative examples from the domain of Computational Literary Studies are provided. The key contribution of this article, therefore, is a proposal for a transparent terminology underpinned by a systematic model of the conceptual space of repetitive research.},
